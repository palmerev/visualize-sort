# visualize-sort
_**Javascript implementing merge sort**_

This project will be a simple visualization of merge sort using vanilla Javascript. I would like the visual aspects of it to match the algorithmic steps. I am using Jasmine to test my code in TDD/BDD style.

**Rough development plan / product phases**

- implement the algorithm on a single test array
- add some checking for edge cases and errors
- start by displaying a button that will sort the test array instantly (no visualization)
- once it is sorting correctly, add the ability to split the array into a collection of divs
- display the divs in unsorted order, then in sorted order
